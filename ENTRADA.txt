My name is Sangeeta. I am 11. 
I live in New Delhi, India with my father,
 mother, two brothers and three sisters.
 My grandparents also live with us. In India, 
family is very important. It is common to have grandparents,
 aunts, uncles and/or cousins living in the same house. My aunts,
 uncles and cousins also live nearby. We see each other often. 
My older brother is a computer programmer. 
Right now, he is in Australia. His company sent
 him there for one year. We all miss him a lot.
 We write him letters every week. I want him to come home soon.
